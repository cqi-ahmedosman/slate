# Get Started with Qi-Pay Hosted Payment Page 

This guide walks you through the steps required to integrate with Qi-Pay platform using hosted payment page method. Both domestic Qi cards as well as international cards are accepted. The advantage of this integration method is it requires minimum development on the merchant side. Nothing is required for this method to work except the merchant ID and API secret key corresponding to the merhcant (i.e. no JS files or SDK's to be installed on the merchant servers). These values could be crearted by the merchant directly via the self service portal which shall be provided upon project progress. 


# Authentication

> To authorize, you have to get your API public key from Qi testing team. The below value is specifically generated to the project in hand:

```API public key```
```
key = 'sbpb_NjNjNzkyN2ItYmQ1YS00NWQ4LWEwYzAtYTY2ODI2Njg4Y2Mw' 
```

```Merchant ID```
```
ID = '36869324'
```

<aside class="notice">
This value is created for the sole purpose of being used in this initiative with limited functioanlities associated. Upon project progress and proper documents are signed the full functionalities shall be proivded and merchant shall be able to manage their own keys.
